# ThePhantomOfTheOpera

Hello and welcome to my implementation of the phantom of the Opera Games.
If you don't know the games, here we go for the rules.

First of all, we are in an opera, so we have a singer. Wich sing.
With also have a phantom and an inspector. The goal of the inspector is to find the ghost, because when he scream he disturb the singer. Wich is not great for the spectator.
Speaking of spectator, we have 8 differents persons, with different capabilities. (More on that later)

# Core

Why ? Because first of all, why not. And because it is freaking incredible. The algorithm as always the same complexity, and work pretty wall, as far as i see.
